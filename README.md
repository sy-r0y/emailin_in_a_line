This was an application that I'd been planning to develop for quite some time but never really got around to implementing it.

IDEA: 1. Get an emailing application that allows a "member" to write up an email, 
      2. Provide a time when the created email would be sent, 
      3. List out other "members" who can edit the email within that time frame, 
      4. Allow the members the priviledge to edit the time limit.

DISCLAIMER 1: I got the idea for this from a seminar of a Harvard open course(www.CS50.net). Its a superb place to learn some super awesome stuff and I would Highly recommend it.

DISCLAIMER 2: "emailin_in_a_line" is a STUPID name..I know...I just coudln't come up with anything better than this!!

WARNING: This is still only developed for "development" mode, so it wont actually "send" any emails-- will have to change it to "production" mode for that to happen.
