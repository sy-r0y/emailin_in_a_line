This was an application that I'd been planning to develop for quite some time but never really got around to implementing it.

IDEA: 1. Get an emailing application that allows a "member" to write up an email, 
      2. Provide a time when the created email would be sent, 
      3. List out other "members" who can edit the email within that time frame, 
      4. Allow the members the priviledge to edit the time limit.
